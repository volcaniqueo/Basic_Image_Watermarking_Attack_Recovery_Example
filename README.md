# Basic_Image_Watermarking_Attack_Recovery_Example
This project was my 2nd Homework for the course CMPE 362 (Introduction to Signal Processing for Computer Engineers) at Bogazici University. This project uses MATLAB environment for a basic implementation of an image watermarking &amp; attack &amp; recovery example.

## Details
Details of the watermarking & attack & recovery algorithm can be found in the project description. Even though the algorithm and the implementation is simple, it is a great example to learn the ideas of image watermarking & attack & recovery.

## To Run the Code
The code can be easily run with MATLAB application. Make sure you have the example images and the code in the same directory.
